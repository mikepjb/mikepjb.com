# Introduction

Vim and Emacs are both excellent editors, I find it very hard to choose between them. I'm currently
writing this article in (Neo)vim with Emacs open behind it.

I don't like to tinker for too long, it seems like time wasted but time spent contemplating how to
do things and why they matter has left me with some points I'd like to share.

    - Integration...
    - Actual editing speed (vim is said to be a really good editor, emacs has everything except for
      one)
    - I dislike evil mode. why? too many chainsaws.
