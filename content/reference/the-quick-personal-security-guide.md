- App based 2FA (no the same as phone number 2FA)
- 2 bank accounts where only 1 is on your main phone. E.g I have HSBC which pays me my salary/bills and Monzo for everyday spending. This guarantees if it's physically stolen I can still pay stuff and only lose a limited amount of money.
- Backup codes on physical USB, all accounts these days can be recovered via backup codes, save them on a backup codes USB key (and keep it very secure LOL), also good for recovering accounts if someone dies and you need access for whatever reason.
- Dark web monitoring.. either use email provider that does this for you (e.g Proton, a swiss-based provider) or use haveibeenpwned, this way you get sent emails when a breach happens and can react before a criminal does.
- Have secure passwords (e.g anyone3-$bluenight14-FDoij33), use a password application for this - I recommend you have this on your phone with cloud based backup so again if stolen it can be recovered.
- Do not use your browser to save passwords for you if you carry your device around in public (e.g to/from work) & do not rely on it as a password store.
- Never log in on someone else's device
- NEVER use free wifi (it's not free, people can analyse your network data)
- Do not use face unlock
- Do not email secure information e.g passwords
- Do not use recovery questions that are based on your personal info (e.g your mother's maiden name question should be.. grapevine or something that isnt actaully answering the question, easy to fool.)
- Keep your system up to date, 100% install new updates, have auto updates on your web browser especially.
- Active screen lock when idle and don't leave your computer unlocked.
- Use AI screening to block spam calls, this way you are never bothered by them and they can't even tell if the phone number is in use. They can't record your voice etc.
- (for the paranoid) isolate money based accounts from social media/newsletter/consumption accounts e.g Youtube using 1 email and bank using another.
- (maybe?) Don't use "Sign in with X (e.g Google or Apple), this ties your accounts together - if one is compromised, they all are."
